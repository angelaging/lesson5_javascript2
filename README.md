### Project Description:
(This assignment asks you to build a calculator behind the scenes of a front facing webpage.
This assignment asks for you to utilize a if/else statement in order for the users country
choice to correctly populate. It also asks you to clear the statements and webpage, which
is beneficial to any webpage or program you are building. You also have to push your 
assignment to GitHub, which helped me understand more about how to push out data to an outside source.)
